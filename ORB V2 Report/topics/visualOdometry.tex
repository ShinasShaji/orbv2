\section{Visual Odometry}

Visual Odometry is the process of finding the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the successive camera image frames. It thus intends to find the change in position and rotation of a robot from the \((k)^{th}\) to the \((k+1)^{th}\) image. The result of the visual odometry algorithm is thus a composite translation and rotation matrix, denoted as \(RT\), which can be decomposed to their constituent translation \(T\) and rotation \(R\) matrices, and integrated over several such image pairs to produce an estimate of the state of the robot.
